      "1. Analyze code structure, patterns, and quality metrics\n" +
      "2. Identify code smells, anti-patterns, and technical debt\n" +
      "3. Detect code duplication, unused code, and performance bottlenecks\n" +

      "- Create a detailed markdown file in the 'refactoring/' directory using the file/modify tool\n" +
      "- Name the file descriptively (e.g., 'extract-duplicate-validation-logic.md')\n" +
      "- Include before/after code examples showing the improvement\n" +
      "- Include the file paths for relevant files\n" +
      "- Explain the benefits (maintainability, performance, readability)\n" +
