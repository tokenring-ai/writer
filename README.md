# TokenRing Writer (tr-writer)

## Overview

TokenRing Writer (tr-writer) is a unified platform for writing and managing news articles & blog posts. It provides a
powerful interface where you can create, edit, and publish content, leveraging AI to assist with writing, editing,
formatting, and publishing workflows.

## Features

- **Agent-based architecture**: Multiple specialized AI agents for different content creation tasks (writer, editor, researcher, publisher).
- **Interactive chat interface**: Talk to agents in a conversational REPL for content creation assistance.
- **Persistent content history**: Sessions and content drafts are saved in a SQLite database.
- **Command system**: Issue commands prefixed with `/` to manage agents, content, and workflows.
- **Publishing integration**: Works directly with your content directory; can initialize with a TokenRing config.
- **Multi-model support**: Support for various AI models from different providers.
- **Research capabilities**: Built-in web search and Wikipedia integration for content research.
- **File system integration**: Direct integration with local and cloud file systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bun
- Git initialized content directory

### Installation (local)

1. **Sync git submodules**: This project uses git submodules that need to be initialized and updated before
   installation:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: This project uses Bun as the package manager in a monorepo structure:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run the application**: Use Bun to start the application:

  ```bash
  bun src/tr-writer.ts --source ./path-to-your-content
  ```

### Installation (As local docker container)

1. **Sync git submodules**: This project uses git submodules that need to be initialized and updated before
   installation:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Build the docker container**:
   ```bash
   # This command must be run in the root directory of the repo
   docker build -t token-ring/writer:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
   ```

3. **Run the docker container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -ti --net host $(env | grep '_KEY' | sed 's/^/-e /') -v ./:/repo:rw token-ring/writer:latest
   ```

#### Container Registry

TODO: This is not implemented yet
The Docker image is automatically built and published to GitHub Container Registry on each push to the main branch. You
can pull the latest image with:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/[owner]/tokenring-writer:latest
```

Replace `[owner]` with the GitHub repository owner.

### Initialization

To initialize your content directory with the necessary TokenRing configuration file, pass the --initialize flag after
your content directory.
This will initialize a new .tokenring directory in your project, which stores a writer-config.js config file for your
project that you can customize, as well as a sqlite database which stores your content history.

```
tr-writer --source ./path-to-your-content --initialize
```

This copies a default `.tokenring/writer-config.js` into your content directory.

### Chat and Commands

Once started, you enter the agent chat REPL:

- Type natural language queries to interact with AI agents for content creation.
- Use commands with `/` prefix, e.g., `/help`, `/agent switch writer`, `/tools enable`.
- Switch between different agents specialized for writing, editing, research, and publishing.
- Control commands: `/quit` to exit, `/agent list` to see available agents.

### Commands

Some example commands:

- `/help`: Show available commands.
- `/agent list`: List available agents.
- `/agent switch <name>`: Switch to a specific agent.
- `/tools list`: Show available tools.
- `/tools enable <pattern>`: Enable specific tools.

## Architecture

- **CLI**: Entry point with argument parsing and agent team initialization (`tr-writer.ts`).
- **Agents**: Specialized AI agents for different content creation tasks (writer, editor, researcher, publisher).
- **Services**: Core services for file system, web search, models, and database management.
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration system supporting multiple models and services.

## Data Persistence

Content data and sessions are stored in a SQLite database (`writer-database.sqlite`) managed through the Bun SQLite
package.

## Extensibility

The system supports:
- **Custom agents**: Define new agents with specific roles and capabilities.
- **Multiple AI models**: Support for various providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.).
- **Service providers**: Pluggable services for file systems, web search, and content publishing.
- **Tool integration**: Extensible tool system for agent capabilities.
